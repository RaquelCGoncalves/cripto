About TP2:
This paper is about 20 cryptograms that were generated using the OneTime Pad in an incorrect way.
The cryptograms are known to correspond to two clear text messages, ciphered with different keys-except in the case of two cryptograms,which were ciphered using the same key.

About TP4:
Three encryption schemes are studied: encrypt-then-mac, encrypt-and-mac, mac-then-encrypt. 

About TP5:
In the first part two modular congruence systems were solved.
In the second parta the cryptogram in this exercice was provided through the use of the RSA “textbook”.
